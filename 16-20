    <li>Prep:5 mins</li>
    <li>cook:10 mins</li>
    <li>serves:8</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ingr">ingredients</h2>
<ul class="food">
    <li>350g self raising flour</li>
    <li>1/4tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>
    <li>85g of butter cut into cubes</li>
    <li>3 tbsp of caster sugar</li>
    <li>175ml of milk</li>
    <li>1tsp of vanilla extract</li>

<p class="sco-1"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 220c oven,200c gas 7.Tip 350g of self-raising flower into a large bowl with 1/4tsp salt and 1 tsp baking powder, then mix.</p>

<p class="sco-2"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 85g worth of butter cubes then rub in with your fingers until looks fine like crumbs then stir in 3 tbsp of caster sugar.Put 175ml milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about 30 seconds until warm, but not hot.</p>

<p class="sco-3"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a squeeze of lemon juice,then set aside for a moment. Put a baking sheet in the oven.Make a well in the dry mixture,then add liquid mixture and combine it quickly with cutlery knife-it will seem pretty wet at first.</p>

<p class="sco-4"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out.Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flower,then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it is a little smoother.Pat into a round shape about 4cm deep.Take a 5cm cutter and dip it into some flour.Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have 4 scones.You may need to press what is left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four.</p>

<p class="sco-5"><strong> Step 5:</strong> Brush the tops with a beaten egg,then carefully place onto the hot baking tray.Bake for 10 mins until risen and golden on the top.Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking,generously topped with jam and clotted cream.If freezing, freeze once cool.Defrost, then put in a low oven(about 160c/fan and 140c/gas 3) for a few minutes to refresh.</p>
